The post–Cold War international environment favored the rise of competitive authoritarianism.
As multiparty elections spread across the globe, countries with reasonably favorable domestic
conditions (including Mexico, Poland, South Africa, and Taiwan) generally democratized.
But multiparty rule also diffused to many states with highly unfavorable conditions for
democracy: impoverished countries with dysfunctional states, tiny middle classes, and weak
oppositions and civil societies (such as Benin, Haiti, Madagascar, and Mali); postcommunist
countries with oversized states and undersized private sectors and civil societies
(Armenia, Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine); or countries characterized by all of these conditions
(Albania, Cambodia, North Macedonia, and Romania). These were countries that, according to
nearly all existing social-science research, “should” have been authoritarian, but external
pressure compelled their elites to permit a degree of pluralism and elec- toral competition.
Thus, regimes that would very likely have been out- right dictatorships in another historical
context became hybrids during the post–Cold War era.
